```javascript
//customStore.js
import reducer from "./reducer";
function createStore(reducer) {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];
  function subscribe(listener) {
    listeners.push(listener);
  }
  function dispatch(action) {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    for (let i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++) listeners[i]();
  }
  function getState() {
    return state;
  }
  return {
    subscribe,
    dispatch,
    getState
  };
}
export default createStore(reducer); 
```

### Debugging in Devtools Redux

Log monitor --shows init actions and other actions in which reducers have payload
Inspector -- most used
Chart -- visual tool

In right we can select different projects which are currently open.

What is inspector monitor.
It shows log of actions that has taken place.
The action tab in right side shows currently selected action and their object and properties which have name and payload.
> The State tab shows state after a action has been applied
> The diff tab shows the difference in state that has taken place. 

What is Tracing?
npm i redux-devtools-extension
import {devToolsEnhancer} from "redux-devtools-extension";
> createStore(reducer, devToolsEnhancer{trace: true}):

we need do some change in webpack.config.js
> devtool: "source-map"

then restart the server
we change external editor as vscode in settings

### Exporting and Importing 
we can reload the application state as samefor the user.
Log Rocket is used at production level.
at the actions can be uploaded from up arrow in devtools.

### Clean code

>this is called ducks patterns where we club different files
![[Pasted image 20230703141937.png]]

#### Ducks Pattern
rules
1. reducer has to default export
2. export individuals action creators

### Redux Toolkit

npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
  
import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

### Creating Actions

import {createAction} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

### Creating Reducers

import {createReducer} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

### Creating Slices

import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

it automatically create actions and reducers. and createSlice is the only function we need.

## Designing the Store

### Redux State vs Local State

### Structuring the Store

objects do preserve the order
in arrays we slower find (lookup)
we can also have the mixup

### Combining the reducers

make file reducer.js
combine different reducers here
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';

### Normalization

we should not duplicate data
we can use normalizr to normalize data from API

### Selectors

### Memiozing selectors with Reselect

npm i reselect

import {createSelector} from "reselect";

### What is MiddleWare

It is function between action dispatched and reducer


### Setting up an Backend

the approach

reducer should not have to call any API
